A [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) plugin that automates your job search end-to-end: find matching positions, auto-fill applications, generate cover letters, write proposals, and prep for interviews - all powered by your resume.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/) is required by utility scripts (auto-installed on first run if missing)

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/suxrobgm/jobpilot.git
claude --plugin-dir ./jobpilot
```

![Launching JobPilot with claude --plugin-dir](docs/images/launch.png)

> Use `--recursive` to pull the [humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer) submodule.

### 2. Set up your profile

```bash
cp profile.example.json profile.json
```

Edit `profile.json` with your personal info, resume path, credentials, and job board config. See [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) for the full reference.

### 3. Allow browser permissions (recommended)

Add to `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "mcp__plugin_jobpilot_playwright__*"
    ]
  }
}
```
